# Hi, I'm Ronnie! :)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! (which is rather empty - most of my work is in aerospace so yk, i'll update my personal ramblings eventually maybe)

## About Me

At the fundamental level, I consider myself pretty much an aspiring renaissance men. I love the intersection of Science and Art, so basically a full stack human per se. 
A full stack human implies that i've to be a full-stack engineer which i'm always working towards. 
I believe that creating new tech frontiers and pushing existing ones is how i can contribute to the civilisation for 'd(civilization)/d(ronnie)' to be maximum. 

I've tinkered with pretty much every field, say-
- mechanical (built stuff from napkin sketch to protyping using most advanced precision machining processes on the face of the planet imo, additive as well as subtractive); 
- software (i've always seen software as a tool rather than a standalone stuff, I've hardcoded neural networks from scratch to aid multiple advanced mathematics applications and                     research studies, from a simple asteroid arcade game to a black hole simulation study), 
- electrical/electronics (I've designed pcbs, soldered components on pcb boards, i still need to build something at microfab level tho)

Most of my works are pretty multidisciplinary, much like courses and departments in my transcripts (Mechanical, Electrical, CS, Physics, Economics and what not!)  
I think i can learn and do pretty much everything, when i know what i'm gonna build. 

currently working on developing swarm of satellites at my university, my work ranges across multiple teams as per project needs namely Systems, Communications, Grounds and more. 
my work trajectory is summarised in my resume. 

i enjoy reading and immersing myself in cinema (i would like to make some too) 
i love music (varied genres and languages, tho music is just a specific output of wave functions which is pretty universal) 
i enjoy multiple form of dancing too. 
i fly planes (in process of my ppl); i ride horses; i love motorbikes (yes, i own a husqvarna!); working on my swimming recently as well.
